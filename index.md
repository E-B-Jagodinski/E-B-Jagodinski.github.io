## About Me

Current doctoral candidate at Florida Atlantic University with a focus on Machine Learning and Fluid Mechanics. 
My background is in systems engineering studying underwater robotics and received my bachelors and masters in 
Ocean Systems Engineering. Since then, I've moved into Data Science and Physics for my dissertation where I 
found a passion for programming and computers.

## Current Research

Turbulent fluid dynamics are called the [last great challenge of classical physics](https://cosmosmagazine.com/science/physics/turbulence-trouble/): 
the archetype of a chaotic, 
nonlinear system where small changes can result in dramatically different outcomes. The difficulty posed 
by this problem coupled with the far reaching and valuable applications are why it is [one of the biggest 
prizes in science and mathematics](https://theconversation.com/millennium-prize-the-navier-stokes-existence-and-uniqueness-problem-4244). 
Simulations of this environment come with a heavy computational burden 
and generate large amounts of data. It is no wonder that fluid dynamics researchers ride the latest trends 
in data analysis including deep learning. 

Traditional control schemes of turbulent flow bring together data analysis and and engineering controls for 
dimensionality reduction and feedback controls which rely on a priori knowledge of the system and fine-tuning. 
Deep Reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of  Deep Learning which gives the pattern finding agent the ability 
to take actions in a state in order to learn cause-and-effect relationships which is currently being applied to many 
topics from [timing insulin application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09051), 
to [defeating the world champion at Go](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961), 
to [smart grid energy optimization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8468674). 
RL branches the two requirements of control schemes for turbulent fluids simulations, data analysis and feedback control, 
in a way that puts it in a unique position for success in turbulent flow control and why I chose to use it for my dissertation.
